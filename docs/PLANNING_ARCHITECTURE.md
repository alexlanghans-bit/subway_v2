# Subway 2.0 — Planning Architecture (12k-in-10 Reset)
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-11-27

> Working document to guide a 10-year, intentional reset of the U.S. network to ~12,000 elite units, integrating ownership mix, portfolio management, labor, real estate, technology, and food relevance into a single operating system.

---

## 0) Executive Summary
- **End-state (Year 10):** ~12,000 U.S. restaurants operating at modern standards (image, equipment, tech, menu) with higher average AUV and stronger 4-wall economics.
- **Method:** Option 3 (**Hard Reset**): buyouts, closures, relocations, and transfers—paired with a **corporate/JV spine (~5%+)** and a **Tier 1 operator club** to test, prove, and enforce change.
- **Phasing:** Three passes across the map (Years 0–3, 3–6, 6–10) that progressively remove weak assets, consolidate operators, and harden standards.
- **OS stack:** Four integrated operating systems — **Labor OS**, **Real Estate OS**, **Tech OS**, **Food OS** — ensure decisions align with modern restaurant economics.
- **Cultural shift:** From counting stores to **managing a portfolio**.

## 1) Non‑Negotiable Design Principles
1. **Unit economics > unit count.** Target robust 4‑wall EBITDA and ≤3.5‑year payback; no growth lever can violate this outside controlled tests.
2. **Disciplined density.** Central approvals; algorithmic trade‑area impact testing; “no net system profit loss” rule for new units.
3. **Corporate spine.** Maintain strategic corporate/JV markets to test menus, formats, pricing, and tech before scaling.
4. **Fewer, better franchisees.** Prioritize multi‑unit, capitalized operators; most new franchisees come from the internal talent ladder.
5. **Enforceable standards.** Real authority to block sites, mandate remodels, relocate, reacquire, or non‑renew.
6. **Data and tech as core infrastructure.** One stack across POS, digital, loyalty, KDS, labor, and inventory.
7. **Franchisee prosperity is the strategy.** Transparent benchmarking; decisions must show impact on 4‑wall profit.

---

## 2) End‑State Targets (Year 10)
- **U.S. units:** ~12,000 (band 11.8k–12.2k) with ongoing open/close portfolio management.
- **Ownership mix:** ~95% franchised; **5%+ corporate/JV spine** (labs, prototypes, flagship DMAs).
- **Economics (illustrative gates):**
  - AUV: configured per format/market (benchmark table to be maintained).
  - 4‑wall EBITDA: 18–22% after stabilized operations.
  - Labor %: templated bands by sales tier and format; scheduling auto‑assisted.
  - Occupancy/Rent %: strict caps by format; remodel payback < 4 years.
- **Quality & compliance:** 100% image/tech/menu capable; zero legacy boxes that can’t run Food OS.

---

## 3) Operating Systems (OS)

### 3.1 Labor OS (labor is the constraint)
- **Thesis:** Fewer people, higher skill, higher pay, higher output—enabled by design and tech.
- **Design:**
  - Right‑sized footprints; flow‑optimized makeline; 3–6 person peak crews.
  - Role architecture and pay bands with a credible internal ladder (Crew → Shift → AGM → GM → MU Lead → Candidate Franchisee).
- **Mechanics:**
  - Auto‑forecasting and auto‑scheduling to labor targets.
  - Standardized staffing templates by sales band/daypart.
  - Digital training, guided KDS, and visual SOPs to reduce ramp time.
- **KPIs:** Labor % vs target, productivity ($ sales per labor hour), training time to proficiency, retention by role.

### 3.2 Real Estate OS (off‑premise first)
- **Thesis:** The brand is off‑premise centric with selective, efficient dine‑in; rent and capex disciplined to modern volumes.
- **Formats:**
  - **Pickup‑first inline** (small box, digital shelf).
  - **Drive‑thru/double lane** where viable.
  - **Non‑traditional/co‑located** (C‑stores, travel, campuses) with clear economics.
  - Larger dine‑in only for A+ flagships.
- **Legacy actions:** Convert (shrink), relocate, or exit big/poor boxes over the 10‑year window.
- **Site selection:** Data‑driven white‑space and capacity models; strict cannibalization thresholds.
- **KPIs:** Occupancy %, build/remodel capex per sales dollar, dine‑in utilization, off‑premise mix, site ROI/payback.

### 3.3 Tech OS (the nervous system)
- **Guest:** Unified app/web/kiosk/drive‑thru brain; loyalty‑led personalization; direct ordering preference; AI order‑taking where accuracy proven.
- **Ops:** KDS everywhere; guided makeline; digitized food safety/labels; inventory tied to sales; COGS anomaly detection.
- **Labor:** Forecast‑driven schedules; templates; compliance guardrails.
- **Network:** Box‑level P&L, trade‑area health, cannibalization analytics; standardized test→prove→scale pipeline.
- **KPIs:** Digital mix, 1P vs 3P, order accuracy, speed, forecast error, waste/shrink, promo ROI.

### 3.4 Food OS (brand promise that doesn’t drift)
- **Governance:** Culinary Council (corporate chefs + top operators + consumer insight); standing complexity budget.
- **Architecture:** Stable **Core Menu (≈90%)** + controlled **Innovation Layer (≈10%)**.
- **Protocol:** Test in corporate/JV/Tier‑1 markets → prove desirability, margin, feasibility → stage rollout; cull low performers.
- **Cadence:** Platform refresh every 3–5 years (e.g., bread/protein/hot line); nutritional and quality perception improvements.
- **KPIs:** Attach rates, mix, margin, throughput impact, guest satisfaction, complexity score.

---

## 4) Portfolio Management Engine (Backbone of the Reset)
### Tiering
- **Tier 1 (Flagship/Growth):** Top AUV, compliant image/tech, strong ops; priority for LTOs, formats, and growth rights.
- **Tier 2 (Transitional):** Clear improvement plan with time‑bound milestones and support.
- **Tier 3 (Exit/Consolidate):** Chronic underperformance or misfit; managed closure, relocation, or transfer.

### Tools
- **National heatmap:** AUV/economics, overlap, trade‑area capacity, remodel status, operator score.
- **Rules:** No new store that reduces neighbor below target AUV/margin; zero tolerance for junk sites.
- **Authority:** Block sites; mandate remodels; buy/transfer; non‑renew when standards not met.

---

## 5) Buyout / Closure / Transfer Mechanisms
- **Consolidation & Reinvestment Fund:** Dedicated capital for buy‑fix‑refranchise, relocations, and structured exits.
- **Voluntary exit packages:** Sliding incentives; accelerated timelines for obvious negatives.
- **Funded transfers:** Move stores to Tier‑1 MU operators with remodel commitments.
- **Corporate/JV acquisitions:** Build the spine in strategic DMAs; later refranchise selectively.
- **Standards enforcement:** Consistent non‑renewals where reinvestment/refit is refused.

---

## 6) Phased 10‑Year Plan to 12k
### Phase 1 — Obvious Surgery (Years 0–3)
- **Actions:** National diagnostic; announce end‑state; launch fund; remove bottom 10–15%; lock Food OS 1.0.
- **Directional count:** ~20k → ~17k–18k.
- **Milestones:** Tiering live; first spine markets running; first remodel/format wave.

### Phase 2 — Strategic Cleanup & Spine Build (Years 3–6)
- **Actions:** Aggressive trade‑area surgery; operator consolidation; expand corporate/JV spine; Food OS 2.0 platform upgrade(s).
- **Directional count:** ~17k–18k → ~14k–16k.
- **Milestones:** Majority of overlap resolved; operator base skewing Tier‑1; tech stack standardized.

### Phase 3 — Precision to 12k & Lock‑In (Years 6–10)
- **Actions:** Non‑renew/relocate remaining marginal units; selective openings in A+ white‑space; institutionalize portfolio management.
- **Directional count:** ~14k–16k → **~12k**.
- **Milestones:** 100% image/tech capable; corporate/JV spine ≥5%; Food OS 3.0 cadence established.

---

## 7) Governance & Org
- **Corporate/JV spine:** ≥5% units as permanent labs; owned or tightly managed markets across top DMAs.
- **Councils:** Franchisee Advisory (menu, marketing, ops) with bounded authority; Culinary Council with data gates.
- **Field support ratios:** Early high‑touch (1:20) → mature (1:40–60) with analytics pods per region.
- **Decision rights:** HQ retains site approval, standards, and portfolio management authority.

---

## 8) Development & Remodel Rules
- **Openings:** Only in pre‑approved white‑space with proven format economics.
- **Remodel cadence:** 7–10 year cycles; incentives tied to timing and full package adoption (image + equipment + digital).
- **Closures/relocations:** Annual bundle decisions; treat the map like an investment portfolio, not a legacy list.

---

## 9) People Engine
- **Internal ladder:** Build‑to‑own pathways; scholarships/financing for top GMs into MU roles/franchisees.
- **Training:** Digital modules, store certifications, and regional academies anchored in spine markets.
- **Employer value prop:** Competitive pay bands, benefits, predictable schedules; leadership development.

---

## 10) KPI Stack (Illustrative Dashboard)
- **Economics:** AUV, 4‑wall EBITDA %, payback, labor %, occupancy %, COGS %.
- **Demand & mix:** Transactions, average check, off‑premise %, 1P vs 3P, digital MAUs, loyalty participation.
- **Ops quality:** Order accuracy, speed, food safety audits, waste %, throughput.
- **Portfolio:** Store count by tier, remodel compliance %, closures/relocations, white‑space progress.
- **People:** Retention by role, training time to proficiency, internal promotions.
- **Brand/Guest:** Satisfaction/NPS, quality perception, value perception.

---

## 11) Risk & Mitigation
- **Operator pushback:** Transparent math, real incentives, funded exits; early wins in spine markets.
- **Capex fatigue:** Remodel bundles with ROI‑positive packages; target relief/fee structures tied to compliance.
- **Tech complexity:** Single vendor spine; staged rollouts; heavy enablement.
- **Food drift:** Culinary Council + complexity budget; kill switches for underperforming items.
- **PR/Brand optics:** Proactive narrative: “fewer, better, modern, profitable, guest‑loved.”
