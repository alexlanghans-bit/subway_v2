# Region Playbook — TEMPLATE
**Region:** <Name> • **Version:** 0.1 • **Owner:** <Name/Role> • **Date:** 2025-11-27

> Purpose: Localize the Subway 2.0 plan to a specific region. This is your operating manual for portfolio actions, formats, labor design, tech rollout, and food localization over the next 12–24 months.

## 1) Region Overview
- **DMAs / Cities covered:** <list>
- **Population / growth trend:** <summary + sources>
- **Income & daytime population:** <summary>
- **Competitive landscape (sandwich/QSR):** <summary + key players>
- **Delivery platforms share (1P vs 3P):** <estimates + trend>

## 2) Trade-Area & White-Space Map
- **Method:** Mobile data + drive-time + demand scoring.
- **Outputs:**
  - Heatmap of current units vs demand.
  - Candidate white-space cells (ranked).
  - Overlap/conflict zones for rationalization.
- **Artifacts:** link dashboards, .geojson, or images.

## 3) Portfolio Tiering
Classify every unit (Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Tier 3). Keep this table live.

| Store ID | Address | Tier | AUV Band | EBITDA Band | Image/Tech | Notes/Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 12345 | 100 Main St | 1 | $$ | % | Up-to-date | Anchor store; candidate for format test |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Rules:**  
- Tier 1 gets first access to formats/LTOs; growth rights.  
- Tier 2 has a dated improvement plan.  
- Tier 3 in exit/transfer/relocation workflow.

## 4) Format Strategy (Right-Size Footprints)
**Primary formats to deploy (check all that apply):**
- [ ] Pickup-first inline (target rent %, target capex, staffing template)
- [ ] Drive-thru / double-lane (throughput targets, lane logic)
- [ ] Non-traditional / co-located (C-store, travel, campus)
- [ ] Flagship dine-in (rare; justification required)

**Legacy conversions:**  
List big-box leases to shrink, relocate, or exit with timing and ROI.

## 5) Labor OS — Regional Settings
- **Wage bands & differentials (role ladder):** <table>
- **Staffing templates by sales band/daypart:** <attach table>
- **Recruiting channels & EVP:** <notes>
- **Training:** Digital modules, KDS, certification flow per role.
- **KPIs:** Labor %, sales per labor hour, retention, time-to-proficiency.

## 6) Tech OS — Rollout Plan
- **Stack readiness:** POS, app/web, kiosks, KDS, inventory, scheduling, analytics.
- **Pilots:** AI drive-thru, phone bot, personalization tests (stores & dates).
- **Data & dashboards:** Links + owners.
- **KPIs:** Digital mix, order accuracy, speed, forecast error, waste/shrink.

## 7) Food OS — Localization
- **Core adherence:** SKU/complexity budget respected.
- **Innovation layer:** Regional LTOs (if any), suppliers, tests in Tier 1.
- **Quality & nutrition targets:** <notes>
- **KPIs:** Mix/attach, margin impact, throughput, guest satisfaction.

## 8) Remodel & Capital Plan
- **7–10 year cycle:** List stores due by year.
- **Bundles:** Image + equipment + digital must go together.
- **Funding:** Regional incentives, fee relief, JV options.
- **ROI gates:** Payback < 4 yrs; exceptions require approval.

## 9) Annual Portfolio Actions (12-Month Roadmap)
- **Closures (target):** <#> with sites listed
- **Relocations (target):** <#> with areas
- **Transfers/M&A:** <#> target; operator consolidation narrative
- **New builds (white-space only):** <#> with justification
- **Milestones & owners:** <table by quarter>

## 10) Dashboard Targets
| KPI | Target | Current | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AUV | $ | $ | | |
| 4-wall EBITDA % | % | % | | |
| Labor % | % | % | | |
| Occupancy % | % | % | | |
| Digital mix | % | % | | |
| Order accuracy | % | % | | |
| Remodel compliance | % | % | | |

## 11) Risk Register
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lease exits costly | M | H | Early negotiations, sublease | RE Lead |
| Operator pushback | H | H | Incentives, transparent math | Ops Lead |
| Tech adoption | M | M | Training, phased rollout | Tech Lead |

## 12) Comms Plan
- **Internal:** cadenced updates to operators; publish wins and before/after case studies.
- **External:** local PR for flagship remodels/openings; articulate food & experience upgrades.

## 13) Appendix
- Density/cannibalization rules (regional parameters).
- Format spec sheets (localized rent/capex/labor numbers).
- Contact map (region team + operator council).

**Maintenance:** Update monthly. Version this document and log changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.
