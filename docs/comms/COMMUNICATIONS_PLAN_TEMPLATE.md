# Communications Plan — TEMPLATE
**Audience:** Franchisees, Operators, Field Teams, Vendors • **Version:** 0.1 • **Date:** 2025-11-27

## Objectives
- Align on 12k-in-10 reset (why, how, what's in it for operators and guests).
- Provide predictable cadence and transparent metrics.
- Share wins and case studies; reduce rumor and fear.

## Cadence
- **Monthly** operator bulletin (KPIs, closures/relocations executed, remodel progress).
- **Quarterly** webcast + Q&A (Food OS roadmap, Tech OS rollouts, portfolio status).
- **Regional** town halls before major portfolio actions.

## Core Messages
1. Fewer, better stores → stronger economics.
2. Corporate/JV spine exists to prove what works before mandates.
3. Food OS protects quality and profitability (test → prove → scale).
4. Portfolio management is continuous (open/close/relocate as needed).

## Artifact Checklist
- Slides (exec summary + regional detail)
- FAQ (closures, incentives, standards, timelines)
- Case studies (before/after economics & guest outcomes)
- Dashboard links (read-only)

## Stakeholders & Approvals
- Comms lead, Ops lead, Legal, Finance, Culinary, Tech.

## Risk & Escalation
- Monitor social chatter & media.
- Rapid response templates for negative narratives.
