## Operating Systems Overview

The transformation is powered by four integrated operating systems that ensure decisions align with modern restaurant economics:

| OS | Core Thesis | Primary Focus |
|----|-------------|---------------|
| **Labor OS** | Fewer people, higher skill, higher pay, higher output | Labor is the constraint |
| **Real Estate OS** | Off-premise first, selective dine-in | Rent and capex discipline |
| **Tech OS** | One stack across all operations | The nervous system |
| **Food OS** | Brand promise that doesn't drift | Menu governance |

---

## Labor OS

**Thesis:** Fewer people, higher skill, higher pay, higher output—enabled by design and tech.

### Design Principles
- Right-sized footprints; flow-optimized makeline; 3–6 person peak crews
- Role architecture and pay bands with a credible internal ladder:
  - Crew → Shift → AGM → GM → MU Lead → Candidate Franchisee

### Mechanics
- Auto-forecasting and auto-scheduling to labor targets
- Standardized staffing templates by sales band/daypart
- Digital training, guided KDS, and visual SOPs to reduce ramp time

### KPIs
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Labor % vs target | Actual labor cost compared to target |
| Productivity | $ sales per labor hour |
| Training time | Time to proficiency by role |
| Retention | Retention rates by role |

---

## Real Estate OS

**Thesis:** The brand is off-premise centric with selective, efficient dine-in; rent and capex disciplined to modern volumes.

### Formats

| Format | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Pickup-first inline** | Small box, digital shelf | Default new build |
| **Drive-thru/double lane** | High throughput | Where viable |
| **Non-traditional/co-located** | C-stores, travel, campuses | Clear economics required |
| **Large dine-in** | Full experience | A+ flagships only |

### Legacy Actions
- Convert (shrink), relocate, or exit big/poor boxes over the 10-year window
- Data-driven white-space and capacity models
- Strict cannibalization thresholds

### KPIs
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Occupancy % | Rent as percentage of sales |
| Build/remodel capex | Per sales dollar |
| Dine-in utilization | Actual vs. capacity |
| Off-premise mix | Percentage of total orders |
| Site ROI/payback | Investment return timeline |

---

## Tech OS

**Thesis:** Technology as the nervous system—unified, data-driven, guest-focused.

### Guest Layer
- Unified app/web/kiosk/drive-thru brain
- Loyalty-led personalization
- Direct ordering preference
- AI order-taking where accuracy proven

### Operations Layer
- KDS everywhere; guided makeline
- Digitized food safety/labels
- Inventory tied to sales
- COGS anomaly detection

### Labor Layer
- Forecast-driven schedules
- Templates by daypart and volume
- Compliance guardrails

### Network Layer
- Box-level P&L visibility
- Trade-area health analytics
- Cannibalization detection
- Standardized test→prove→scale pipeline

### KPIs
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Digital mix | % of orders via digital channels |
| 1P vs 3P | First-party vs. third-party orders |
| Order accuracy | Correct orders / total orders |
| Speed | Average order completion time |
| Forecast error | Predicted vs. actual demand |
| Waste/shrink | Loss as % of inventory |
| Promo ROI | Return on promotional investment |

---

## Food OS

**Thesis:** Brand promise that doesn't drift—governed innovation, controlled complexity.

### Governance
- **Culinary Council:** Corporate chefs + top operators + consumer insight
- **Complexity Budget:** Standing limit on menu items and SKUs

### Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         FOOD OS STRUCTURE           │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Core Menu (≈90%)                   │
│  - Stable foundation                │
│  - Proven performers                │
│  - Operational efficiency           │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Innovation Layer (≈10%)            │
│  - Controlled testing               │
│  - LTOs and seasonal                │
│  - Candidate for core               │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Innovation Protocol
1. **Test** in corporate/JV/Tier-1 markets
2. **Prove** desirability, margin, feasibility
3. **Stage** rollout with enablement
4. **Cull** low performers

### Cadence
- Platform refresh every 3–5 years (bread/protein/hot line)
- Nutritional and quality perception improvements
- Continuous optimization

### KPIs
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Attach rates | Add-on item performance |
| Mix | Product mix analysis |
| Margin | Per-item profitability |
| Throughput impact | Effect on kitchen speed |
| Guest satisfaction | Customer feedback scores |
| Complexity score | Operational complexity index |

## Community as Infrastructure

**The comeback needs more than software—it needs people.**

### Existing Community Assets

| Community | Scope | Role |
|-----------|-------|------|
| **WhatsApp Coalition** | ~60 franchisees, 1,000-1,500 stores | Grassroots organizing, pilot recruitment, real-time feedback |
| **NAASF** | National association (longstanding) | Formal franchisee voice, policy advocacy |

### The WhatsApp Coalition

A growing community of franchisees representing **5-7% of all US Subway stores**. This is:

| Asset | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Proof of demand** | Franchisees want change and are organizing |
| **Pilot pool** | Ready group to test new initiatives (Devapp1, Check-In, etc.) |
| **Feedback channel** | Real-time input from operators in the field |
| **Trust network** | Peer relationships that corporate can't manufacture |

### NAASF (North American Association of Subway Franchisees)

An established franchisee association with:
- **History** — Long track record of franchisee advocacy
- **Credibility** — Recognized voice for operators
- **Challenge** — Historically strained relationship with franchisor

**The opportunity:** If the Comeback can align NAASF and corporate around shared goals, it transforms an adversarial relationship into a partnership. The new social contract provides the framework.

### Why Community Matters

| Without Community | With Community |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Top-down mandates | Bottom-up buy-in |
| Resistance to change | Champions for change |
| Slow adoption | Rapid pilot recruitment |
| Corporate echo chamber | Real operator feedback |
| "Us vs. them" | "We're in this together" |

**Community is not a nice-to-have. It's infrastructure for change.**

The WhatsApp coalition and NAASF represent existing social capital that can accelerate every aspect of the transformation—from testing new features to advocating for the partnership model with corporate.

*"You can build the best strategy in the world. But without a community to carry it, it stays on paper."*
