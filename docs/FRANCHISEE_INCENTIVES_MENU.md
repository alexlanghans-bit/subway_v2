> Toolkit for aligning operator behavior with the 12k-in-10 reset. Use combinations, condition on compliance & ROI, and include clawbacks.

## A) Remodel / Image Compliance
| Scenario | Incentive | Conditions | Clawback |
|---|---|---|---|
| On-time remodel (within cycle) | **Royalty relief** 100 bps for 6 months | Full package: image + equipment + digital | If capex scope reduced or late |
| Early remodel (≥12 mo early) | **Royalty relief** 150 bps for 6 months + **ad fund match** up to \$15k | Tier-1 ops; location meets ROI gates | If KPI lift underperforms and SOPs not followed |
| Full package + training certification | **Fee rebate** (waive local fees up to \$5k) | All managers certified; pass QA | Reversed if QA fails twice in 12 months |

## B) Closures / Relocations
| Scenario | Incentive | Conditions | Clawback |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voluntary exit (Tier-3) | **Closure grant** up to \$30–50k | Signed within window; surrender rights | If reopens nearby with competitor |
| Relocation to A+ site | **Capex co-fund** up to \$150–250k | Old site closed; new meets ROI | If new site not opened on schedule |
| Merge trade area (close 1 of 2) | **Royalty relief** 100 bps for 12 months | Remaining store hits service targets | If staffing or service KPIs missed persistently |

## C) Operator Consolidation (M&A)
| Scenario | Incentive | Conditions | Clawback |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tier-1 acquires weak cluster | **Interest buydown** + **capex bundle** | Commit to image/ops in 12 months | Rebate reversed if not complete |
| Transfer to elite operator | **Transfer fee reduction** | Clean compliance record | None if closing KPIs met |

## D) Growth in White-Space
| Scenario | Incentive | Conditions | Clawback |
|---|---|---|---|
| New store in pre-cleared white-space | **Founders royalty** 50–75 bps reduction for 24 months | All specs met; team certified | If KPIs < thresholds without remediation |
