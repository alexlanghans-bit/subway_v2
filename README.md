**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-11-27

This repository starter bundles the core strategy artifacts for the Subway 2.0 program targeting a disciplined 10-year reset to ~12,000 elite U.S. units.

## Contents
- `docs/PLANNING_ARCHITECTURE.md` — End-to-end planning architecture (12k-in-10 reset).
- `docs/GREENFIELD_STRATEGY.docx` — Greenfield 30-year scaling plan (1–2 stores to 20k).
- `docs/FULL_CHAT_TRANSCRIPT.docx` — Transcript of key strategy discussion for context.
- `README.md` — You are here.

## Quickstart
1. Create a new repo and add this zip’s contents.
2. Keep `docs/PLANNING_ARCHITECTURE.md` as the canonical planning doc.
3. Add region playbooks and dashboards in `/docs/regions/` and `/dashboards/`.
4. Version changes via semantic versions; log rationale in a `CHANGELOG.md`.
